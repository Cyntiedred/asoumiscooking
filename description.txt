Hey Everyone! Welcome to the description of the #asoumiscooking cookbook!

The aim of this cuteness is to practise my Python skills and create some useful but fun programme.

Since I love cooking (I mean, really love cooking) and try new tastes, I need a programme where I can collect my recipes, ideas,
fridge capacity and so on. Nothing hard diet, just nice dishes!

To solve this programme I gonna write a programme, which:

- Collects the ingredients that I have in my kitchen, separate by food types and save it to a .csv file
- Allows me to add new recipes, tagged with ingredients and then save it to a .txt file
- Sort recipes in many ways:
 - Cooking time
 - Recipe orientation (Italian, Asian, Hungarian, ect.)
 - Used ingredients (meat type, veggies, spices)


The structure of the programme:

- Main menu:
    - Fridge:
        - What is in my fridge?
        - Selected by:
            - Name
            - Type 
            - Amount
        - Add ingredients
        - Remove ingredients
        - Modify amount of ingredients
        /Data structure of an ingredient: ID, Name, Type, Amount, calorie/100 grams
    - Cookbook:
        - Recipes
            - Soup
            - Main dishes
            - Desserts
            - Select by:
                - Orientation (Chinese, Japan, Italian, Hungarian, etc.)
                - Meaty, Vegetarian or Vegan 
                - Easy, Medium, or hard
                - Ingredients
        /Data structure of a recipe: ID, Name, Category, Orientation, Type, Difficulty, Ingredients
        - Add new recipe
    - Calorie calculator:
      - Calories of a recipe ( sum of Ingredient amounts / 100 grams)
      - Calories of an ingredient
